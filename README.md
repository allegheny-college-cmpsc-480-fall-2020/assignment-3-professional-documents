## Overview
 
### Writing professional documents

Many of you likely already have a document which functions as a résumé. For those of you who do not, or for those of you whose professional documents might need a bit more than a touch-up, this assignment offers the opportunity to use a variety of resources, including your peers, to develop a complete document which takes your career narrative work into account. Rather than the somewhat abstract terms that your narrative might use, your résumé should be focused on the discrete and specific characteristics of either your education or current employment history which _demonstrate_ skills required of a professional position.

I write "résumé" a lot in the above paragraph. For some of you, you'll be looking more squarely at a curriculum vitae (C.V.). Our readings this week highlight the differences between the traditional résumé and C.V. In many places outside the United States (and increasingly _inside_ the U.S.), these terms are interchangeable. However, insofar as graduate schools, fellowships, and some professional positions require, the document requested is somewhat different. More often, programs are beginning to request résumés. 

Based on your opportunity search conducted over the last week, make a choice as to which document is more appropriate for you.

## Assignment guidelines

Depending on the opportunity/opportunities that you're interested in pursuing, you'll choose to either create a résumé, C.V., or -- in a rare circumstance -- you might consider both. For this assignment, I'd likely err on the side of choosing the document you need more immediately (e.g. a résumé for a full-time or internship posting).

By the end of this activity you should have completed a full draft of whichever document you've chosen following the guidelines below.

### Résumé

1. A final product which:
  * is a 1, but no more than 2, page document
  * "passes" the [résumé review checklist](https://tswqo1aqh6e4d9omrzpjqmtw-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/career/files/2019/01/RESUME-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.pdf)
  * is included in this repository as a `.pdf` or `.docx` file (preferably a `.pdf` to preserve your formatting) in the `writing` directory
2. A text-only version of the résumé as a `.txt` or `.rtf` file
3. Draft work completed as part of class activities in the `draft` folder

### C.V.

1. A final product which:
  * is a 1+ page document
  * "passses" the [C.V. review checklist](http://www.kumc.edu/Documents/counseling/Curriculum%20Vitae%20Review%20Checklist.pdf) and general principles in Northeastern's [How to Write a Grad School Résumé](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/how-to-write-a-grad-school-resume/)
  * is included in this repository as a `.pdf` or `.docx` file (preferably a `.pdf` to preserve your formatting) in the `writing` directory
2. A text-only version of the resume as a `.txt` or `.rtf` file
3. Draft work completed as part of class activities in the `draft` folder


## Preparation for activities

### 18 September

#### Résumé

Either:

  * a substantial list of skills (between 15 - 20 or more) derived from completing the [skills worksheet](http://sitesmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/career/files/2016/11/SkillsEmployersSeek.pdf), and/or
  * one entry for work experience which contains (at minimum):
    * the name of the company/organiztion
    * the title of the position
    * dates of employment
    * 3 bullet points detailing the responsibilities of the position which:
      * are concise (no more than 25-50 words)
      * use active verbs (e.g. "organized," "inventoried," "created," "maintained," et al.)
      * highlight achievements or improvements made
      
Based on your work experience, have in mind [which type of résumé]((https://careerwise.minnstate.edu/jobs/resumecharts.html)) you're thinking about:

  * chronological
  * functional
  * combined

#### C.V.

This work does not need to be formatted; it should likely just be a bullet-pointed list.

 * A list of all applicable sections which might appear on your C.V.
  * Use the list of recommended sections provided by [the UNC Writing Center guide](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/curricula-vitae-cvs-versus-resumes/)
 * Ideas for what could go in each of these sections, without too many specifics at this point -- just list everything that you think applies to a given section
 * A proposed order/organization of sections

### 25 September

For either track:

  * a completed draft of your professional document to share with your group, along with
  * any challenges or lessons learned to share as part of a 5-7 minute miniature presentation

### Grading criteria

Like many assignments in this course, assessment of this work is based on completeness. I may indicate that you should revise this assignment which is an opporunity to receive full credit for the assignment should there be missing points or content.
